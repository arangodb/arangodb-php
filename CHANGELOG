  Fixed bug, written missing tests and corrected documentation

* issue #21: Added hiding of fields for documents. Written tests and documentation.
  Implemented new feautre, written tests and documentation

  Hiding of fields for documents:

      This applies to getAll(), __toString(), toJson() and toSerialized().
      getAll() now can be passed an array of options instead of the boolean 'includeInternals'.
      DocumentHandler::get() and getById() can also be given those options

      CollectionHandler::byExample() can also be given those options

      All the above functions except the __toString can be given an array of options
      currently these options are:

      'includeInternals' - true to include the internal attributes. Defaults to false

      'ignoreHiddenAttributes' - true to show hidden attributes. Defaults to false


* issue #18: Implemented revision check with policy = "error" 
  for update/replace and delete/remove methods.

* issue #14: Refactored function names to better match the server api.
  This results in sevaral methods being deprecated:

DocumentHandler:
  update(), updateById() => These are replaced by replace() and replaceById(). They will have their behavior changed in api version 1.1 in favor for the update method that has been added in ArangoDb 1.1

  delete(), deleteById() => These are replaced by remove() and removeById(). They will be removed in api version 2.0.

  add() => This is being replaced by the new save() method. add() will be removed in api version 2.0.

  getByExample() => This is being replaced by CollectionHandler::byExample(). byExample() will be removed in api version 2.0.

  getAllIds() => This is being replaced by CollectionHandler::getAllIds(). getAllIds() will be removed in api version 2.0.

CollectionHandler:

  add() => This is being replaced by the new create() method. add() will be removed in api version 2.0.

  delete() => This is being replaced by the new drop() method. delete() will be removed in api version 2.0.

  getCount() => This is being replaced by the new count() method. getCount() will be removed in api version 2.0.
